Just walked out of Marching Powder. My brain's still rattling, like a bird banging against a window repeatedly. The   theater was noisy, gotta say, with a ‘symphony’ of popcorn chewing and awkward coughing. Like a zoo but for humans. Where to even start? 

The scene with the guards laughing — it reminded me of those hyenas at the savannah. Gleeful. Yet a weird kind of mirth, mixing cruelty with... what? Relief? It’s like they were momentarily out of the cage, only to step right into another. Like my poor back, trapped in this cramped seat. 

Those moments where Thomas stood alone, the walls looming — they made the prison seem alive. Metaphorical carnivorous plants, creeping inwards. Could literally feel the weight of bricks, man. 

> Oh, and how could I forget the bizarre juxtaposition: popcorn crumbs on my lap like dandruff against a black shirt. The carpet in the isle, sticky battlefield of lost sugar, the bombshells of dropped nachos. My shoes, casualties in a war I didn't sign up for.

Anyway, the whole drug connection — it slithers through the   like a python, squeezing tightly, unwavering. It should've been ridiculous but somehow, it's eerily real. Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 ants in a glass farm, scuttling with blind purpose.

And about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , no idea. Someone did ask if they could 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 — probably legal? But like, maybe check 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹? 

The theatre lights came up, like dawn breaking on a surreal jungle. My mind still trapped, echoes of dialogue replay almost as loud as the kid wailing next to me throughout (why do parents bring toddlers to  s like this???)

int magicWand = 14;
if (dazed == brain) {
   𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩(marchingPowder);
   turnOffReality();
}

There. Done. Thoughts spilled. Off to decompress, perhaps with a less rowdy pack of humans.
